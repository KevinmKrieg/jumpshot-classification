# jumpshots
Machine learning project to create a model capable of identifying when a jump shot occurs based on accelerometry data from a Catapult Sports device.

The device was worn during a hour long shoot around, and the timestamps of jumpshots were recorded, as well as whether the shot came after a dribble or a pass.
